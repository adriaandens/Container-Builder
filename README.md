# Container::Builder

Build containers from scratch

## Current status

**This is a work in progress**

The big goal of this project is to make a distroless Perl container that can easily be used in my own projects whilst containing nothing more than the perl runtime and my application code. It'll go on CPAN when this goal has been reached (and some cleanup has been done).

## Todo

See all the TODO remarks in the code itself. 

## OCI?

I'm not allowed to make any OCI reference without getting certified, but I aim to make my code adhere to the OCI specifications as best as I can.
